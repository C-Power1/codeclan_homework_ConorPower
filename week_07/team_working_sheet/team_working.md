‘Understanding Us’ Worksheet

Everyone in your team should fill this worksheet in individually. Then, share your answers, and have an open discussion in your team about them. Use your findings as a group to agree any ground rules that you think will be useful. Make sure everyone’s answers are shared in a known place during the project so all team members can refer back.

Try to be as honest as possible when answering the questions. The aim of this exercise is to help the group communicate more constructively together, by understanding each other better.



When I have ideas to contribute I tend to... **Put them out there for discussion at team meetings**

I would prefer you to...  **at least listen to the idea (I don't mind if its shot down)
**

When I am stuck I tend to... **try look for the answer on Google and then seek help from teammates and instructors**

I would prefer you to... **be patient if you're explaining and I'm not quite getting a concept first time**


I can feel shy when... **there's conflict between 2 other teammates**

I would prefer for you to... **try leave conflict out of team meetings and address it as soon as you can if possible**



If I am quiet, it’s probably because... **I'm trying to figure something out or work through a problem**

It could be helpful if you... **give me a bit longer to get back to you if you need to speak to me immediately** 



I prefer to work in groups where .... **there's regular meetings and discussion about the big picture and where everyone is working hard and pulling their weight **



I think conflict in groups is best resolved by...

**Organisising set aside time and discussing it as openly as possible**

 You should know this about me...
 
 **I'm pretty easy to get on with and you can approach me at any time.**
